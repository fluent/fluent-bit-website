title: 5 minute guide to deploying Fluent Bit on Kubernetes
---
> Get started deploying Fluent Bit on top of Kubernetes in 5 minutes, with a walkthrough using the helm chart and sending data to Splunk. 

In this guide, we will walk through deploying Fluent Bit into Kubernetes and writing logs into Splunk. For this blog, I will use an existing Kubernetes and Splunk environment to make steps simple. You can also see an architecture diagram below:

## Getting Fluent Bit configuration ready
If you are not familiar with Fluent Bit, it is an open-source application written in C to help ship data from many sources to many destinations. Fluent Bit is exceptionally lightweight, performant, and resilient - which makes it ideal for Kubernetes environments.

To send data to Splunk, we will need to define an output within Fluent Bit configuration. I'll mask the host and Splunk_token parameters and use `tls.verify` to allow us to skip adding the certificate for now.

```
[OUTPUT]
    Name splunk
    Match *
    Host XXXXXXXXXX
    Port 8088
    Splunk_Token xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
    tls On
    tls.verify Off
```

## Deploying via Helm
The simplest way to take this configuration and put it into action is by grabbing the Helm charts from the Fluent repository: https://github.com/fluent/helm-charts/. If you are not familiar with Helm - you can think of it as one of the package managers for Kubernetes, similar to rpm/deb on Linux.

Clone this repo into your workspace. Let's take a look at the structure of the fluent bit chart.

```
├── Chart.yaml
├── README.md
├── templates
│   ├── NOTES.txt
│   ├── _helpers.tpl
│   ├── _pod.tpl
│   ├── clusterrole.yaml
│   ├── clusterrolebinding.yaml
│   ├── configmap.yaml
│   ├── daemonset.yaml
│   ├── deployment.yaml
│   ├── psp.yaml
│   ├── service.yaml
│   ├── serviceaccount.yaml
│   ├── servicemonitor.yaml
│   └── tests
│       └── test-connection.yaml
└── values.yaml
```

Let's modify value.yaml, delete the configured outputs for ES, and insert our configuration from Step 1:

```
  ## https://docs.fluentbit.io/manual/pipeline/outputs
  outputs: |
      [OUTPUT]
        Name splunk
        Match *
        Host XXXXXXXXXX
        Port 8088
        Splunk_Token xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
        tls On
       tls.verify Off
```

With the values.yml saved, and the only output for Splunk configured, we will change into the fluent-bit chart directory and deploy via the following command:

```
helm install fluent-bit .
```
This gives the name `fluent-bit` to the helm chart. We should receive the following acknowledgment, and we should be good to go.
```
NAME: fluent-bit
LAST DEPLOYED: Mon Dec 28 11:22:51 2020
NAMESPACE: default
STATUS: deployed
REVISION: 1
NOTES:
Get Fluent Bit build information by running these commands:

export POD_NAME=$(kubectl get pods --namespace default -l "app.kubernetes.io/name=fluent-bit,app.kubernetes.io/instance=fluent-bit" -o jsonpath="{.items[0].metadata.name}")
echo "curl http://127.0.0.1:2020 for Fluent Bit build information"
kubectl --namespace default port-forward $POD_NAME 2020:2020
```

Let's check Splunk for incoming logs.

## What happening?
The helm chart deploys Fluent Bit as a DaemonSet within the Kubernetes environment, along with proper service accounts and configuration. DaemonSet deployments ensure that every node of Kubernetes will have a Fluent Bit instance running alongside it, capturing all the logs generated from Kubernetes pods.

The remaining configuration in value.yaml also specifies a `filter` plugin that gives fluent-bit the ability to talk to the Kubernetes API server enriching each message with context about what pod/namespace / k8s node the application is running on.

## Conclusion
Logging in Kubernetes is a must as you start to add more and more applications. Thankfully, deploying Fluent Bit is simple thanks to the helm chart's and Fluent Bit's lightweight, performant, and resilient package.
