## Changes

This is a bug fix release over 0.11 series that includes the following changes:

- Core
  - Pack: json-encoding: detect and skip already escaped characters.

- Plugins
  - [Kubernetes (filter)](http://fluentbit.io/documentation/0.11/filter/kubernetes.html): new __merge\_json\_key__ option. If merged json is to be included, this new option acts as a parent key for the new structured fields.
  - [Kubernetes (filter)](http://fluentbit.io/documentation/0.11/filter/kubernetes.html): new __dummy\_meta__ option, when set the filter do not try to gather metadata from the API server, instead it just append a random record as meta. Useful testing and development.
